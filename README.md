# Cityscape-Generator

The Cityscape generator runs by clicking the 'cityscapeGenerator.html' file inside Executables folder.
The program has the functionality to create a random cityscape according to the selected number of
houses and number of floors. The floor number will be random from 1 to selected floors. The 
house and floor number are initially set as 1. The user can save any cityscape by clicking "Save drawing"
and can load it any scene back by clicking "Choose File". The user can also draw clouds to their
drawing by clicking (specifying) the corners of their clouds. The clouds are in front of the sun
and in behind of the houses and trees. The user also can't draw any clouds to the ground.
